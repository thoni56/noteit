# NOTEIT

NoteIt is a rip-off from the revolutionary note-taking app for MacOS, Notae,
which no longer works.

The special thing about NoteIt (and Notae) is that each note can be tagged with multiple
tags. Those tags can then be used to filter notes, which also can be performed hierarchically. So by selecting an initial tag will filter all notes, but also give you a new set of tags that these filtered notes have. This makes it possible to dig down into the emergent relationships of your notes.

It is a meteor project, and as such you run it by

    > cd noteit
    > meteor --port $IP:$PORT

This is really in its infancy. Let's see what happens!
